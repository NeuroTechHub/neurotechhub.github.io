# About NeuroTechHub

## Our Goal

We want to facilitate the development of an open-source ecosystem for neurotech. This includes hardware, software, firmware, and communication standards for interconnecting components. We want to achieve this by making it a community effort where people collaborate and help each other develop solutions together.

Our approach centers on events for knowledge sharing, networking, and developing standards. We welcome the efforts from academics, industry, and individuals alike—everyone has a role to play in building the future of neurotechnology.

## Why Open Source Matters

The neurotechnology field has long struggled with proprietary, closed-source solutions that create barriers to innovation. Researchers face challenges reproducing results, clinicians are locked into specific vendor ecosystems, and promising technologies remain inaccessible due to high costs and restrictive licensing. This closed approach slows progress, limits collaboration, and prevents the field from reaching its full potential.

We believe that an open-source approach is essential for advancing neurotechnology in a way that benefits everyone—from accelerating research to democratizing access to these life-changing technologies.

## Who We Are

NeuroTechHub is a community of neurotechnologists united by a shared vision. Born from international neurotech consortiums, we bring together researchers, engineers, clinicians, students, and innovators from diverse backgrounds.

Whether you're a self-taught neuroAI/ML engineer, a professional clinician, an academic researcher, an industry expert, or simply a curious mind eager to explore exciting new projects and connections—you belong here. We believe that breakthrough innovations happen when diverse perspectives come together in an open, collaborative environment.

Welcome to the next-generation neurotech community!
