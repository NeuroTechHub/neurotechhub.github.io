# Getting Started with Brain-Computer Interfaces

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) might sound like science fiction, but they're very much a reality today. If you're new to this exciting field, this guide will help you understand the basics and get started with your first BCI project.

## What is a Brain-Computer Interface?

A Brain-Computer Interface is a direct communication pathway between the brain and an external device. BCIs can:

- **Decode intentions**: Translate brain signals into commands for computers or devices
- **Provide feedback**: Send information back to the brain through visual, auditory, or haptic channels
- **Augment abilities**: Enhance human capabilities or restore lost functions

## Types of BCIs

### Non-Invasive BCIs
- **EEG (Electroencephalography)**: Measures electrical activity through the scalp
- **fNIRS (Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy)**: Uses light to measure brain activity
- **MEG (Magnetoencephalography)**: Detects magnetic fields from neural activity

### Invasive BCIs
- **ECoG (Electrocorticography)**: Electrodes placed on the brain surface
- **Intracortical arrays**: Microelectrodes inserted into brain tissue

For beginners, we'll focus on non-invasive EEG-based systems since they're safer and more accessible.

## Understanding EEG Signals

EEG measures the electrical activity of large groups of neurons. Key concepts include:

### Frequency Bands
- **Delta (0.5-4 Hz)**: Deep sleep
- **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: Light sleep, meditation
- **Alpha (8-13 Hz)**: Relaxed, eyes closed
- **Beta (13-30 Hz)**: Active, alert states
- **Gamma (30-100 Hz)**: High-level cognitive processing

### Common BCI Paradigms
1. **Motor Imagery**: Imagining movement without actual movement
2. **P300 Speller**: Using attention to evoked responses
3. **SSVEP**: Steady-state visual evoked potentials from flickering stimuli
4. **Alpha Rhythm**: Control through relaxation states

## Hardware Requirements

## Your First BCI Project: Alpha Wave Detector

Let's build a simple BCI that detects when you're in a relaxed state by monitoring alpha waves.

### Step 1: Setup

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import signal
from brainflow.board_shim import BoardShim, BrainFlowInputParams, BoardIds
from brainflow.data_filter import DataFilter, FilterTypes

# Configure your board
params = BrainFlowInputParams()
params.serial_port = '/dev/ttyUSB0'  # Adjust for your system
board_id = BoardIds.CYTON_BOARD.value
board = BoardShim(board_id, params)
```

### Step 2: Data Acquisition

```python
# Start streaming
board.prepare_session()
board.start_stream()

# Collect data for 30 seconds
time.sleep(30)

# Get the data
data = board.get_board_data()
board.stop_stream()
board.release_session()

# Extract EEG channels (typically channels 1-8 for OpenBCI)
eeg_channels = BoardShim.get_eeg_channels(board_id)
sampling_rate = BoardShim.get_sampling_rate(board_id)
```

### Step 3: Signal Processing

```python
# Filter the data (bandpass 1-50 Hz)
for channel in eeg_channels:
    DataFilter.perform_bandpass(data[channel], sampling_rate, 
                               1.0, 50.0, 4, FilterTypes.BUTTERWORTH.value, 0)

# Focus on alpha band (8-13 Hz)
def extract_alpha_power(eeg_data, fs, window_size=2):
    """Extract alpha band power using short-time FFT"""
    alpha_power = []
    
    for i in range(0, len(eeg_data) - int(window_size * fs), int(fs/2)):
        window = eeg_data[i:i + int(window_size * fs)]
        
        # Compute power spectral density
        freqs, psd = signal.welch(window, fs, nperseg=int(fs))
        
        # Find alpha band indices
        alpha_idx = np.where((freqs >= 8) & (freqs <= 13))[0]
        
        # Calculate alpha power
        alpha_power.append(np.mean(psd[alpha_idx]))
    
    return np.array(alpha_power)
```

### Step 4: Real-time Classification

```python
def is_relaxed(alpha_power, threshold=None):
    """Simple threshold-based relaxation detector"""
    if threshold is None:
        # Use median as baseline
        threshold = np.median(alpha_power) * 1.5
    
    return alpha_power > threshold

# Real-time loop
def real_time_alpha_monitor():
    board.prepare_session()
    board.start_stream()
    
    try:
        while True:
            time.sleep(1)  # Update every second
            
            # Get recent data
            data = board.get_current_board_data(sampling_rate)  # 1 second
            
            if data.shape[1] > 0:
                # Process primary channel (e.g., Oz for alpha detection)
                primary_channel = eeg_channels[0]  # Adjust as needed
                
                # Filter
                DataFilter.perform_bandpass(data[primary_channel], sampling_rate,
                                          8.0, 13.0, 4, FilterTypes.BUTTERWORTH.value, 0)
                
                # Calculate alpha power
                alpha_power = np.mean(data[primary_channel] ** 2)
                
                # Simple feedback
                if alpha_power > relaxation_threshold:
                    print("ðŸ˜Œ Relaxed state detected!")
                else:
                    print("ðŸ¤” Active state")
                    
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        board.stop_stream()
        board.release_session()
```

## Tips for Success

### Hardware Setup
1. **Electrode placement**: Follow the 10-20 system for consistent positioning
2. **Signal quality**: Ensure good electrode-skin contact (impedance < 10kÎ©)
3. **Noise reduction**: Work in a quiet environment, avoid electrical interference

### Signal Processing
1. **Filtering**: Always apply appropriate bandpass filters
2. **Artifacts**: Learn to identify and remove eye blinks, muscle tension
3. **Baseline**: Record baseline data in different states for comparison

### Experimentation
1. **Start simple**: Begin with clear, easy-to-detect signals like alpha waves
