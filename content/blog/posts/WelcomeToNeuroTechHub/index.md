# Welcome to NeuroTechHub

Around 2022, we were working in neurotechnology—specifically visual implants—across different academic and industrial teams. We met through [international research consortia](https://intenseproject.eu/) and quickly realized we were running into the same questions again and again: Which stimulation and recording systems actually exist? How should signal analysis be done properly? What does good grounding of your setup look like in practice?

Beyond the technical challenges, we repeatedly encountered the same structural limitation: proprietary technology. Developing new BCI systems often requires expensive, closed components—Omnetics connectors being a common example—that restrict what projects can realistically attempt. Many commercial electrophysiology systems are not limited by their hardware, but by how much freedom their software allows. As a result, research groups frequently end up reinventing the wheel whenever they want to do something even slightly unconventional.

There are, fortunately, inspiring exceptions. A shining example is [Open Ephys](https://open-ephys.org/), who are making open-source software and hardware. In adjacent fields, projects like Pupil Labs demonstrate a similar spirit by openly sharing both [hardware](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/diy/) and [software](https://docs.pupil-labs.com/core/developer/) for eye tracking.

Inspired by these efforts, we started experimenting with ways to bring people together. We [organized](https://neurotechhub.org/talks/) talks, meetups, workshops and a an [Awesome Open Neurotech page](https://neurotechhub.org/blog/posts/awesomeopenneurotech/) which turned out to be deeply motivating experiences. Industry experts were eager to give talks, graduates to explain their theses, and students to participate in workshops. Again and again, we saw that people genuinely want to share their knowledge and are willing to put in extra effort so others can build on their work.

All of this excited us to pursue building the NeuroTechHub: a place to share knowledge, tools, and experiences in neurotechnology, and a way for people working on similar problems to connect, learn from each other, and give back to the community.

We’re not entirely sure yet what this will look like or how it will evolve. What we do know is that it will be a community effort. We’ll continue organizing events and experimenting with formats, and this blog is one small first step. If you have knowledge, tools, experiences you’d like to share, or simply want to help shape what this could become, we would love to hear from you. Send us an email or set up a call, and let’s build the future of neurotechnology together.
