## Event Summary

The TU Delft Neurochallenge at **YES!Delft** brought together a vibrant mix of young neuroscientists, medics, students, and interdisciplinary researchers â€” all with one shared mission: turn bold neurotech ideas into real-world solutions.

We kicked off with two inspiring keynotes:
- **Nicolas Vachicouras** (Co-founder & CEO, Neurosoft Bioelectronics) on building neuromodulation startups and translating innovation from lab to clinic.
- **Dr. Stephen Rainey** (Assistant Professor of Philosophy & Technology, TU Delft) on ethics and neurophilosophy â€” the responsibilities that come with technology interfacing the brain.

Fueled by those talks, participants jumped into a high-pressure **innovation sprint**. The energy, collaboration, and creativity of mixed-background teams (from engineering students to architects and entrepreneurs) really showed whatâ€™s possible when disciplines meet.

### Winning concept: PrintXiety
**PrintXiety** proposed a beautiful fusion of empathy and engineering: use **EEG** to track mental-health progress (e.g., anxiety reduction) and **translate those data into 3D-printed structures**. The resulting objects make psychological change **tangible** â€” from *chaotic to calm*, *rough to smooth* â€” so patients and clinicians can literally see and feel progress.

This NeuroTechHub initiative was led by **Francesc Varkevisser**, **Stijn Balk**, **Antonio Manuel Lozano Ortega**, and **Patricija Burgar** â€” and weâ€™re only just getting started. The event was part of the national **Hersencampagne**, supporting brain research and innovation across the Netherlands.

**Special thanks** to: Martine van Diepenbrugge, Fien Bosman-van Gelder, Janneke den Besten-van Ravenswaaij, Daan Kuitenbrouwer, Rick Bonants, Claire Visser, **TU Delft | EEMCS**, and â€” most of all â€” to all participants for your energy and creativity.

Want to help shape the future of brain-tech? **Reach out â€” weâ€™d love to hear from you.**
