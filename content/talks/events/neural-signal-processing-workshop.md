# Neural Signal Processing Workshop

## Overview

Join Dr. Maria Rodriguez, Senior Research Scientist at the Neural Engineering Lab, for an intensive workshop on neural signal processing. This hands-on session will cover the complete pipeline from raw neural data to actionable insights.

## What You'll Learn

### Part 1: Preprocessing Essentials (30 minutes)

- **Filtering techniques**: Bandpass, notch, and spatial filters
- **Artifact removal**: Eye blinks, muscle tension, and line noise
- **Reference strategies**: Common average, mastoid, and Laplacian
- **Data quality assessment**: Impedance checking and signal validation

### Part 2: Feature Extraction (45 minutes)

- **Time domain features**: Statistical measures and waveform analysis
- **Frequency domain features**: Power spectral density and band power
- **Time-frequency analysis**: Spectrograms and wavelet transforms
- **Spatial patterns**: Common spatial patterns (CSP) and ICA

### Part 3: Classification and Validation (30 minutes)

- **Machine learning basics**: LDA, SVM, and neural networks for BCIs
- **Cross-validation strategies**: Subject-specific vs. cross-subject
- **Performance metrics**: Accuracy, ITR, and practical considerations
- **Real-time implementation**: Considerations for online systems

### Part 4: Hands-on Demo (45 minutes)

- **Live coding session**: Complete pipeline using Python/MNE
- **Sample dataset analysis**: Motor imagery classification
- **Q&A and troubleshooting**: Bring your own data challenges

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with NumPy and SciPy
- Understanding of basic signal processing concepts (helpful but not required)

## Required Software

Please install before the workshop:

```bash
pip install mne numpy scipy scikit-learn matplotlib
```
